      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I am an aspiring web developer with an extensive background in digital marketing and sales.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I was born and raised in Minnesota and have never had a permanent address in any other state.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>I like to stay active via yoga, running, dance, etc. I also enjoy creative hobbies like clothing design and sewing as well as illustration and graphic design. If I've been looking at a screen all day, I also appreciate an old school paperback book.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>I aspire to become a successful full-stack developer.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>I currently live in the suburbs, but planning to move back downtown Minneapolis. I miss the chaos of the city.</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I'm a bit of a free spirit that also has a constant curiousity about how I can improve something. I'm passionate about technology, a bit of a perfectionist, and enjoy pushing the boundaries to see what else is possible. I believe all of these things fit nicely with the description of a web developer.</p>
